# Privacy Policy for Wiki2Grok Extension

**Last Updated**: November 2, 2025

## Overview

The Wiki2Grok Chrome Extension ("the Extension") is committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and your rights.

## Data Collection

### What We Collect
The Extension collects and stores **only**:
- **One user preference**: Your auto-redirect setting (ON/OFF)

### What We DO NOT Collect
- Personal information
- Browsing history
- Search queries
- IP addresses
- Cookies
- Analytics or tracking data
- Any data from Wikipedia or Grokipedia pages

## How We Use Data

The auto-redirect preference is stored locally in your browser using Chrome's `storage.sync` API. This setting:
- Controls whether you see a popup or are automatically redirected
- Syncs across your Chrome browsers if you're signed into Chrome
- Can be changed at any time through the extension settings
- Is never transmitted to any external servers

## Data Storage

- All data is stored locally on your device
- No data is sent to external servers
- No third-party services are used
- No analytics or tracking tools are implemented

## Permissions

The Extension requests these permissions:

- **`storage`**: To save your auto-redirect preference locally
- **`tabs`**: To detect when you're on a Wikipedia page
- **`host_permissions` for Wikipedia**: To run the redirect functionality only on Wikipedia pages

These permissions are used solely for the Extension's core functionality and nothing else.

## Third-Party Access

- We do not share any data with third parties
- We do not sell any data
- We do not use advertising networks
- When you click to visit Grokipedia, you are subject to Grokipedia's own privacy policy

## Your Rights

You can:
- Change your auto-redirect setting at any time
- Uninstall the Extension at any time
- All stored data is automatically deleted when you uninstall

## Children's Privacy

This Extension does not knowingly collect any information from children. It is a simple redirect tool with no data collection capabilities.
